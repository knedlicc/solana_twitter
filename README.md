# Autumn School of Solana 2023
</div>

## Final Task
As the School of Solana run is slowly nearing its end, the most important task for you is to implement the final dApp. Within this task, you should utilize all your prior experience, as well as all the knowledge you've gained in this course. Lastly, feel free to implement whatever comes to your mind, it may result in a truly great idea!


## Task details
This Task consists of two parts:
1. **Core of your dApp**
    - deployed Solana program
2. **Frontend**
    - Simple Frontend in order to interact with the dApp


## Requirements
- An Anchor program using a PDA deployed on **Devnet** (obviously **Mainnet** also possible).
- At least one TypeScript **Test** for each Anchor program instruction. These tests should cover both the happy path and the unhappy path scenarios (unhappy = tests that intentionally trigger errors).
- A simple **Frontend** deployed using your preferred provider (for more info, check below).
- A **Readme.md** file with:
    - A brief **Description of your project**, explaining how it works and its purpose.
    - If you have successfully deployed the Anchor program and the frontend, provide a **Link** where we can view the results.
    - Instructions on **How to build and test** your Anchor program locally.
    - Instructions on **How to run the frontend** app locally (this is optional for those who deploy frontend).

## Ideas
- **Social app**
    - Twitter,
    - Instagram,
    - Giphy,
    - Friendtech,
    - Spotify
- **Chat** - [Dialect](https://www.dialect.to/)
- **Blog**
- **Voting** - [D21 - Janeƒçek method](https://www.ih21.org/en/guidelines)
- **DeFi**
    - Crowdfunding
    - Raffles
    - Escrow
    - Tipping
    - Lending ([Solend Documentation](https://docs.solend.fi/)),
    - Liquid Staking ([Marinade Documentation](https://docs.marinade.finance/)),
    - data query with Pyth ([Pyth Documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/solana-price-feeds)),
    - AMM ([Raydium Documentation](https://raydium.gitbook.io/raydium/))
- **Gaming**
    - Browser Game ([Gaming on Solana](https://solanacookbook.com/gaming/nfts-in-games.html#token-gating-with-nfts)),

## Deadline
The deadline for this task is **Tuesday, November 14th, at 23:59 UTC**.

## Submission
Within this repository, you can find two folders: one meant for the Anchor project, and the second meant for the frontend. Feel free to update this structure if you need to.


## Evaluation
Evaluation process is based on the **Requirements**. That means if you meet the requirements you pass the Final Task.

## Example Workflow
Let\`s say you are going to implement the Twitter dApp as Final Task. The steps could be:

**1.** Implement Twitter dApp using the Anchor Framework.

**2.** Test the Twitter dApp using the Anchor Framework.

**3.** Deploy the Twitter dApp on the Solana Devnet

**4.** Using the Solana Scaffold described within the Frontend Lecture, implement Frontend for the Twitter dApp.

**5.** If you find problems within your dApp return to **2.**

**6.** Publish Frontend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

**7.** Describe dApp within the Readme (Frontend + Anchor project)

**8.** Submit the Twitter dApp using GitHub Classroom.

This is example workflow, feel free to use your own path !!
